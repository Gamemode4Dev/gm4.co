        <h1>Rules & Community Guidelines</h1>
        <p>
          We have a few rules and guidelines that lay out expectations for how everyone behaves; these are here to ensure that Gamemode 4 is a fun place for everyone, and you don't accidentally ruin someone else's experience. These apply to all spaces within Gamemode 4, and failure to do so will result in punishments. As long as you're a nice person and use common sense, you shouldn't have trouble following these rules.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="respect">
        <h2>Respecting Others</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone here wants to enjoy themselves; to do this, you must always treat others with respect, dignity, and consideration. Be mindful of everyone and how what you are saying can be taken. Meanings can get lost, misinterpreted or considered offensive. Not everyone will have the same sense of humour or knowledge as you.<br />
          To help achieve this, we expect the following:
        </p>
        <h3>No Hate Speech or Discrimination</h3>
        <p>
          Any sexist, racist, or offensive messages or comments will not be tolerated. Swearing is allowed as long as it is not directed at someone.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Do not make public or share another person's personal information without consent.<br />
          Harassment, stalking, or doxxing of community members will be punished, even if it occurs outside the Gamemode 4 environment.
        </p>
        <h3>No Harassment</h3>
          <p>
            Harassment of any kind toward others, or promoting/misleading others to break the rules, is not allowed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </section>
      <section id="spam">
        <h2>No Spamming</h2>
        <p>
          Spam of any kind is not permitted. Consequently, sending repeated or similar messages, flooding chat/channels, using all CAPITAL letters, randomly pinging/tagging others or sending messages with zero meaning may be classified as spam by staff and punished accordingly.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="account_responsibility">
        <h2>Account Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for your account and all actions taken by that account, even if another person uses your account.
          Rule-breaking will result in the responsible account being disciplined.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="impersonation">
        <h2>Impersonation & Ban Evasion</h2>
        <p>
          Attempting to impersonate others is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to tricking people into believing you are someone else and/or trying to assert that you are staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using alternative accounts is not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While on the public Minecraft server, members may apply nicknames for fun; these can be identified by starting with ~. If nicknames are similar to those of other community members, you must have their consent.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="staff">
        <h2>Staff</h2>
        <p>
          Staff members can be recognised by their Discord role and in-game prefix. Only staff are allowed to enforce these rules. If you see others breaking them, please get in touch with staff via Discord immediately and let them handle it.<br />
          Do not ask for staff; only active community members selected by the current staff team receive staff. There is no way to apply for staff directly.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="server">
        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <p>
          While on the public Gamemode 4 server or any official GM4 server, we have a few other rules that must be followed in addition to the ones above! These are in place to allow everyone to enjoy the server, ensure a fair experience, and help keep things organised. When playing with others, remember everyone has their own playstyles and actions, and that PVP is not allowed without their explicit consent first.
        </p>

        <h3>No Cheating, Hacking, or use of Disallowed Modifications</h3>
        <p>To keep the server fair for everyone, you may not grant yourself an unfair advantage or put others at a disadvantage. Any form of client or client modification that provides gameplay-altering advantage or significant non-vanilla features is not allowed, as is the use of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bugs or Exploits</li>
          <li>Macros or hotkeys</li>
          <li>X-Ray texturepacks, mods, or vision</li>
          <li>
            In-Game Duplication Exploits*<br>
            <i>* Duplication may only be allowed if it's carpets specifically for map art!</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Claims and Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          Our server does not use claim or ownership plugins; instead, you may claim any location of reasonable size and place your belongings anywhere, as long as you do not break any other rules.<br />
          Mark your claim and belongings so they stand out as player-made
          Claims must be smaller in high-traffic areas
          We reserve the right to revoke your ownership of a claim if you are no longer playing regularly. For high-traffic areas, playing regularly refers to you having been engaged with the server within the last 30 days; for all other areas, 90 days.
          If you notice a vacant build, you may contact the owner or staff, who may be able to revoke previous ownership if you have a good reason to take over the claim or items.
        </p>
        <h3>Respect Others' Builds</h3>
        <p>
          Build a reasonable distance away from others' builds and respect the terrain, surroundings, and appearance of nearby builds.<br />
          Do not crowd, cover, block, or deface others' builds.
        </p>
        <h3>No Stealing</h3>
        <p>
          Stealing in any shape or form is not allowed. This means you cannot take anything that is not yours, regardless of whether you know who owns it. This includes taking items from an unlabeled chest or containers you might find around.
        </p>
        <h3>No Griefing</h3>
        <p>
          Griefing, i.e. modifying another player's build without permission, is not allowed on the server. Griefing includes but is not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>Placing or removing blocks</li>
          <li>Activating or modifying redstone</li>
          <li>Moving or killing entities</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Excessive Lag</h3>
        <p>
          Do not cause lag. Builds that cause lag will be warnable, and we reserve the right to kick you and remove builds in the case of excessive lag. This means you should take actions to keep entity counts low and ensure farms are well-regulated. Complex redstone contraptions should also be kept away, and chunk loaders are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ender Pearl stasis chambers are allowed, as long as they do not cause excessive lag.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="punishments">
        <h2>Punishments & Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Failure to follow these rules and the essence they display will result in warnings and temporary bans. Excessive rule-breaking will result in permanent banning.<br />
          You may appeal any punishment on the Discord server through the public server help channel, in which case, another unassociated staff member will review your appeal.<br />
          You can report any incident where you think a rule has been broken or that suspicious behaviour has occurred through the same channel, and a server mod will review it and restore any damage.
